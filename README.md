# Running gravitational constant induced dark energy as a solution to σ8 tension

This repository contains code for the paper titled "Running gravitational constant induced dark energy as a solution to σ8 tension". 

## Folder Structure

- utils.py contains the necessary helper functions
- generate_plots.ipynb generates the plots
- Cij_WiggleZ.txt contians the covariance matrix for WiggleZ data
- data_growth_2016_main.txt contains independent fsigma8(z) dataset (cf. Table 1 in the article)
- requirements.txt contains the list of used libraries

## Reproducibility

The results presented in the article can be reproduced using GCDM.ipynb

Please note that the all scripts are developed in Python (version 3.11.9)
